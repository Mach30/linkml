.,.,"General mapping spec notes: 1. This is getting more complicated, but good. I think we need at least 2 types of notation: simple, and full. Simple can probably leave out indices [i], [i2], etc. Should basically just be the dot notation. Full is everything else in the mapping spec. If just simple is specified, then the spec recommends that implementer uses a lookup map of string to callable func, where the string is the 'simple spec' dot notation path of the source spec field path, and the func is what is necessary to transform and put in the target path. else, if full, should be able to interpret by spec and do mutation without any other mutations needed by implementer.;2. should extensions be like .extension[linkml:field: val] or just leave the linkml: part out? 3. indexing [i], [i2] and so on; 4. [*] means applies to every instance of the array. i guess the array has to be built first by any other fields that map to it. this makes the mapping language parser much more complex because has to look for all fields and resolve, and can be recursive.; 5. [] means new entry into array.; 6. =VAL means assign directly to val. i guess this needs a type system unless only supports ""STRING"".; 7. ",,.,.,.,.,.
